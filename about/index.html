I am a Master&rsquo;s student in Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. Here, I am studying a mixture of statistics, math (linear algebra, discrete), algorithms, and economics. My academic niche is applied statistical learning, currently focusing on variable selection techniques, high-dimensional data processing, and causal inferences in health-related topics. My long-term goal is to leverage data science to drive rigorous evidence-based decisions that improve social and health outcomes. I am confident about Python, R, and SQL, although I still try to improve my Python programming and problem solving skills through Advent-of-Code puzzles and Kaggle competitions. Before graduate school, I used to work for an non-profit organization in Vietnam, in database engineering and program evaluation, where I learned a lot about civic technology. Other than academic and professional activities, I immerse myself in crime thrillers, ethical dilemmas, English football, and satirical shows."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Hi!
