Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plans changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.
I am a Master&rsquo;s student in Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago
. Here, I am studying a mixture of statistics, algorithms, and machine learning. My current research focus is (1) multimodal deep learning used in cancer risk predictions and (2) reasoning using graph in vision-language models in biomedicine and healthcare, utilizing efficient embeddings/feature extraction methods. Here is my latest project on the former: A Deep Learning Multimodal Approach to Survival Risk Prediction in Kidney Cancer Patients (code
 and paper
). I&rsquo;m exploring the current literature on the latter."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Xin chào, I am Hiếu!"><meta name=twitter:description content="Profiles: GitHub - LinkedIn - Email - Resume Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon.
