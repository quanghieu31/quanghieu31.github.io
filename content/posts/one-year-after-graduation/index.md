I planned to post something nerdy first on this website but I just remember I graduated on this day, May 22, one year ago. Time does fly. It seems that my butterfly worrying feelings days before the graduation day were crystal-clear present as if it were yesterday. Since that day, my mentality and emotions have fluctuated pretty much, you know, being an actual adult, no cap. Although I am grateful for everything so far, particularly the experiences and people I had from Dickinson College and my current employment and mental state, I can't help but feel... regretful. 

To be honest, I did not have the greatest preparation for the job market until the final year of college. It was, I think, too late for me to well graps my abilities and employment opportunities. I did not even comprehend which industry I would go deep into - I guess either economics research or some vaguely data things. Another struggle is my own self-esteem and moral values. I was significantly exposed to loads of progressive and socialist ideas, I feel like I could serve the justice and characterize the good/bad. Pretty extreme, not good enough. This cliché of self-sabotaging oneself, I know. The fact that I failed almost all the job applications might be an obvious indicator justifying the self-degradation. 

All of my closed friends in Dickinson College had great pursuits after graduation, either a job or a higher education. They are all amazing and talented people. Without them, I could not survive the academic rigor and social fatique at school. Now they are in the US getting the bread and paying college debts all by themselves, growing mature and independent. I thus feel the desparate comparisons I impose on myself, despite not much recently. 

So, I rushed to prove myself again. While working, I applied and got into a master's program in University of Chicago, but little scholarship. I applied to a famous but difficult external scholarship in Vietnam and just got the news of rejection. What a life. But, it may mean a good thing. The more I think, the more I feel the rush has been overwhelming me - a rest or slowdown is needed. So, although I will need to take loans or spend more looking for scholarships, I will defer the admisison to next year and slow things down. I am also taking time to learn what I like and try to incorporate the economics and math stuff from college into my skills. 

Still, there are many entangled responsibilities and ideals. I am still trying to figure things out. Part of this struggle is some mini/long encounters with lovely people, which relieves the hyperfatique (a lot). I came to realize many positive ideas about my family, friends, and co-workers. It may not be an overestimation if I say they keep me in this life. The thing is, I cannot let them down, fueling the pressure hahaha. Being an adult is "fun" and fun.

Last words. I know this essay is messy because it was spontaneous. I saw the graduation ceremony photos at Dickinson with some familiar faces of my professors and friends. It hit me emotionally. Dickinson was a great chapter in my life despite that first semester of freshman year and covid-19. I do regret that I could have worked more resiliently and stayed less extreme ideologically. Well, it's always that "could have", eh. 

I just hope that I will be satisfied soon, and people around me are frequently happy and live till 150 years old. Let's see.
