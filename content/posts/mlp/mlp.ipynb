    "\n",
    "Goal: Explain how multilayer perceptron model is trained. Mostly for me to understand the foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Half of the battle is the configurations and notations:\n",
    "- Suppose we want to classify 25x25 images and have 10 output labels $(\\textbf{y})$. The data for training are labeled and cleaned. \n",
    "- There are $m$ instances in the data, 625 features, and 10 labels. \n",
    "- The data can be represented as a $m \\times 625$ matrix or tabular-type. For simplicity, we will work with each single training example (i.e. some $x_0$). That is, the input layer is a $1 \\times 625$. As a convention (I believe), we should transpose this matrix and get the $625 \\times 1$ input layer. Then, the output layer is the activations of 10 labels which is a $10 \\times 1$ matrix. Output layer notation: $\\textbf{a}^{(3)} = [ [a_0^{(3)}], [a_1^{(3)}], \\ldots, [a_{9}^{(3)}]]$. To be more general, let $j$ index the output matrix's elements. \n",
    "- Choose 2 hidden layers: the first layer has 5 neurons and uses ReLU as the activation function and the second layer has 8 neurons and uses a softmax function. The number of neurons is arbitrarily selected. Respective layer notations: $\\textbf{a}^{(1)} = [[a_0^{(1)}], [a_1^{(1)}], \\ldots, [a_4^{(1)}]]$ and $\\textbf{a}^{(2)} = [[a_0^{(2)}], [a_1^{(2)}], \\ldots, [a_7^{(2)} ]]$. To be more general, let $k$ index the layer (2) matrix's elements and let $h$ index the layer (1) matrix's elements. \n",
    "- Choose the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function. For one single training example $x_i$, $ℒ_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{9} (a_j^{(3)} - y_j)^{2}$. Then, the overall loss function for all training examples is $ℒ = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \\mathscr{L_i}$.\n",
    "- Choose the Stochastic Gradient Descent technique for mini-batching and randomization optimization. Iterate through each training example (or randomly selected mini-batches of examples) and compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the $W$ and $b$ parameters using that example or mini-batch. Update the parameters with the computed gradients and a learning rate. Repeat the process for multiple iterations (epochs) until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "- Last but not least: weight and bias parameters. They appear in each of the layers except for input layer. \n",
    "    - $\\textbf{W}^{(1)}$ and $\\textbf{b}^{(1)}$ denote the weights and biases of layer (1) in which $\\textbf{W}^{(1)}$ is a $5 \\times 625$ matrix and $\\textbf{b}^{(1)}$ is a $5 \\times 1$ matrix. \n",
    "    - $\\textbf{W}^{(2)}$ and $\\textbf{b}^{(2)}$ denote the weights and biases of layer (2) in which $\\textbf{W}^{(2)}$ is a $8 \\times 5$ matrix and $\\textbf{b}^{(2)}$ is a $8 \\times 1$ matrix. \n",
    "    - $\\textbf{W}^{(3)}$ and $\\textbf{b}^{(3)}$ denote the weights and biases of output layer in which $\\textbf{W}^{(3)}$ is a $10 \\times 8$ matrix and $\\textbf{b}^{(3)}$ is a $10 \\times 1$ matrix.   \n",

    "- Weighted sum $z$ or linear combination of weights and activations along with bias, i.e. for layer $i$, $z^{(i)} = W^{(i)} a^{(i-1)} + b^{(i)}$. \n",
    "- ReLU and softmax. MLP is inherently a linear model and we apply non-linear activation function. \n",
    "    - Why? (1) Nonlinear activation functions allow the network to stack layers and build a hierarchy of features. Each layer can learn different levels of abstraction, where higher layers build upon the outputs of lower layers. (2) The [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) states that a feedforward neural network with at least one hidden layer and a nonlinear activation function can approximate any continuous function to any desired degree of accuracy, given sufficient neurons in the hidden layer. (3) Nonlinear functions ensure that the gradients are non-zero and propagate through the network layers. This gradient back propagation is critical for learning, as it updates the weights based on the error evaluation.\n",
    "    - Why ReLU and softmax? Arbitrary for now. I think I need to dig deeper into the comparisons and criteria for choosing. In the softmax, $j$ in the index of the weighted sum $j$ in the vector $\\textbf{z}^{(i)}$ of layer $i$, then take this exponentially and divided by the total sum of exponential weighted sum across the $\\textbf{z}^{(i)}$ vector, then we get the logit probability. So, softmax is a vector of logit probabilities.\n",
