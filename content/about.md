Eleven years agao, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plan changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.

I develop this web to practice writing concisely and well explaining complex things to me. Current topics mostly regard programming and economics. In the long run, I would like to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic/quant modelling.

I am currently studying Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago (yay). I used to work for an non-profit organization in Vietnam, focusing on database and program evaluation. I did know a little about econometrics and some topology from Dickinson College - amazing times but regrettably under-utilized. I am confident about Python for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning. I like football (the real one), crime thrillers, and satirical shows. Ethical dilemmas are also my niche. And I cannot live without oriental cuisines - my literal and figurative sources of life.

The writings will be mainly produced in Vietnamese and English. Please do share anything with me regarding this web! Thanks for your visit.
