Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plans changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.

I am a Master's student in [Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). Here, I am studying a mixture of statistics, algorithms, and machine learning. My current research focus is (1) multimodal deep learning used in cancer risk predictions and (2) reasoning using graph in vision-language models in biomedicine and healthcare, utilizing efficient embeddings/feature extraction methods. Here is my latest project on the former: A Deep Learning Multimodal Approach to Survival Risk Prediction in Kidney Cancer Patients ([code](https://github.com/quanghieu31/multimodal-ccRCC) and [paper](https://github.com/quanghieu31/multimodal-ccRCC/blob/main/Final_Report_03_2025.pdf)). I'm exploring the current literature on the latter.

I have teaching assistant experiences at UChicago for CAPP 30254: Machine Learning for Public Policy, MPCS 51042: Python programming, CAPP 30122: Computer Science with Applications 2. I practice Python via solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/quanghieu31/) and [Advent-of-Code puzzles](https://github.com/quanghieu31/advent-of-code). I also occasionally compete in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/hieunguyendq). 

Before graduate school, I worked in database programming and program evaluation for a non-profit focused on child development in Vietnam. It was a wonderful time when I learned a great deal about civic technology and was inspired by incredible colleagues and people in the impact areas.

In my free time, I enjoy watching football, cruising the local food scene, and review movies.
