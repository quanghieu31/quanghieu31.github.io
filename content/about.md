Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plans changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.

I am a Master's student in [Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). Here, I am studying a mixture of statistics, algorithms, and machine learning. My current academic focus is machine learning in cancer risk prediction and inference by carefully analyzing multimodal data and utilizing efficient embeddings/feature extraction methods. Here is my latest project on this subject: A Deep Learning Multimodal Approach to Survival Risk Prediction in Kidney Cancer Patients ([code](https://github.com/quanghieu31/multimodal-ccRCC) and [paper](https://github.com/quanghieu31/multimodal-ccRCC/blob/main/Final_Report_03_2025.pdf)).

I have gained extensive experience in Python and SQL through:

- Teaching assistantships at UChicago: 
    - MPCS 51042: Python programming
    - CAPP 30122: Computer Science with Applications 2 
- Problem-solving on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/quanghieu31/) and [Advent-of-Code puzzles](https://github.com/quanghieu31/advent-of-code) 
- Practice with real-world data/machine learning problems in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/hieunguyendq). 

Before graduate school, I worked for a non-profit organization focused on child affairs and development in Vietnam, in database programming and program evaluation, where I learned a lot about civic technology.
