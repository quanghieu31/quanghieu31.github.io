      <description>Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plan changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.
I develop this web to practice writing concisely and explaining complex things. In the long run, I would like to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic modelling.
I am studying Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago.</description>
