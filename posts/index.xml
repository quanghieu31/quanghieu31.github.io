I enjoy sitting in lectures and occasionally interacting with the lecturers. But then I recently realized it is not the most proactive and sustainable way to remember or know why/when/how to use concepts learned from stats class when dealing with a real-world problem. The assignments and projects are helpful but I need to feel natural and comfortable explaining and applying the knowledge later.</description></item><item><title>rrrr</title><link>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/backprop/test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/backprop/test/</guid><description>Hello, my name

Very nice working on your first web! After many weekend hours, you did it. It was thrilling learning experience. I am proud of you, please don&amp;rsquo;t be skeptical of yourself, even though I bet that you are right now haha. Anyhow, if you feel so, remember that everything is going to be daijoubu.
Many thanks to my bro (https://cryptsu.github.io/) who has helped me so much during the design and development.</description></item></channel></rss>
