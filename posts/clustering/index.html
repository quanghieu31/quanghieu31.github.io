It is a natural thing to want to do with large data.
Can reveal a lot about the structure of data → exploratory data analysis.  e.g., finding new types of stars, patients with similar disease profiles, &mldr;
Allows us to compress data by replacing points with their cluster representatives (called vector quantization).

It’s an unsupervised problem → always harder to formalize.
Ill-defined: different objective functions are possible, no clear winner.
Even after clustering, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether the result is good or bad → subjective.
What is the “correct” number of clusters? Also subjective.
Often the data is ambiguous in this regard.
End users may attribute too much significance to clusters, with unforeseeable consequences.
Compared to supervised ML, the theory is in its infancy.

Input: samples ($\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2, \cdots, \vec{x}_n$) $\in \mathbb{R}^p$ and choosen $k$ for number of clusters wanted
Output: $k$ disjoint sets $C_1, C_2, \cdots, C_k$ whose union is ${\vec{x}_1, \cdots, \vec{x}_n}$
Clustering depends on a distance metric, i.e. the simplest would be the Euclidean distance or $d(\vec{x_i} , \mu_k) = ||\vec{x_i} - \mu_k||^2 = \sum_{j=1}^p (\vec{x_{ij}} - \mu_{kj})^2$

Problem: Find $C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_k$ and centroids $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_k \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that minimize this loss function:
$$J_{\text{avg}}^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_j} d(x,m_j)^2$$

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Each data point is a pair $(\vec{x}_i, z_i)$ in which</p><ul><li>$\vec{x}_i$ is a $d$-dim vector of the $i$-th sample ($d$ is the number of features): is observed</li><li>$z_i \in {1\cdots K}$ is the cluster assignment of the $i$-th data point: is hidden.
The key assumption is that each $(\vec{x_i}, z_i)$ is drawn independently from some probability distribution with parameters $\theta$ or $(\vec{x_i}, z_i) \sim \Pr_\theta$. In other words, the probability distribution $\Pr_\theta$ can generate &ldquo;data&rdquo;. This is a probabilistic model.</li></ul><p>In this particular case, we use the Gaussian model to estimate the parameters. That is,
$$\Pr(\vec{x})=\mathcal{N}(\vec{x}|\vec{\mu},\Sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^d|\Sigma|}}e^{-(-(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)/2)}$$
Some key terms to clarify:</p><ul><li>$z$ is in range $1\cdots K$ which are the cluster IDs and there are $K$ clusters. $z$ represents a Gaussian cluster. Remember, this is hidden/unknown before we do anything.</li><li>$\pi_z = \Pr(z=1)$ is the probability of seeing cluster $z$ and $\Sigma_{j=1}^K = 1$.</li><li>$\vec{\mu}_z \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the mean/center of cluster $z$. Note: the vector sign is to make sure this is not a scalar, although this is a single point in the $d$-dim vector space</li><li>$\Sigma_z \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ is the covariance matrix of cluster $z$. Note that, it&rsquo;s not $\sigma$ because we work with $\geq 2$-dim.</li><li>$\Pr(\vec{x}_i, z) =\mathcal{N}(\vec{x}_i | \vec{\mu}_z, \Sigma_z)$ is the probability of seeing $\vec{x}_i$ if $\vec{x}_i$ already in the Gaussian cluster $z$</li><li>Paremeters to care about: $\pi$, $\mu$, $\Sigma$</li></ul><p>So, the marginal probability of a sample, $\vec{x}$, is $$\Pr(\vec{x})=\mathcal{N}(\vec{x}|\vec{\mu}, \Sigma) = \sum_{j=1}^K \pi_j\mathcal{N}(\vec{x}|\vec{\mu}_j, \Sigma_j)$$
For each sample, we want to find the parameters $\theta = (\pi, \mu, \Sigma)$ such that they make $\Pr(\vec{x}$) as high as possible (i.e. more chances to be into &ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;similar&rdquo; cluster). We use statistical estimation like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to attempt to do so.</p><p>So, given dataset $\textbf{X}$ of shape $N \times D$ and of independent samples, we want to maxmize the following probability, $$\Pr(\textbf{X}|\pi, \vec{\mu}, \Sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \sum_{j=1}^K \pi_j\mathcal{N}(\vec{x}_i|\vec{\mu}_j,\Sigma_j) \right]$$
The above probability means that, given the set of parameters (3 of them), the probability of seeing $\textbf{X}$ depends on how each of the samples is being placed into its cluster $j$ among (1 to K) correctly. Intuitively, for each sample $\vec{x}_i$, the model computes a weighted sum of probabilities over all $K$ clusters. Each term in the sum reflects the likelihood that $\vec{x}_i$ was generated by Gaussian cluster $j$. Finally, the product just simply shows that these samples are independent and we&rsquo;re allowed to multiply its probability (after the summing step).</p><p>Now, two important things:</p><p>First, suppose, $z_{i,j} = 1$ if $\vec{x_i}$ is in cluster $z_k$. So, $\Pr (z_{i,k} = 1 | \vec{x}_i)$ is the probability of seeing cluster $z_k$ contains $\vec{x}_i$ or not, given $\vec{x}_i$. Bayes theorem to expand the term:</p><p>$$
\Pr(z_{i,k}=1 \mid \vec{x_i}) = \frac{\Pr(z_k) \cdot \Pr(\vec{x_i} \mid z_{i,k}=1)}{\Pr(\vec{x_i})} = \frac{\pi_k \cdot \Pr(\vec{x_i} \mid \vec{\mu_k}, \Sigma_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \pi_j \mathcal{N}(\vec{x_i} \mid \vec{\mu_j}, \Sigma_j)}
$$</p><p>and also, each point belongs to each cluster <strong>with some probability</strong> and GMM is soft clustering (meaning each data point can belong to multiple clusters at the same time, with degrees of membership (probabilities or weights), instead of being assigned to just one cluster.). Thus, we define this term:</p><p>$$N_k=\sum_{i=1}^N \Pr(z_{i,k} =1 |\vec{x}_i)$$</p><p>This term means the expected number of points in cluster $k$ - a real number, not necessarily an integer.</p><p>Second, to maximize the $\Pr(\textbf{X}|\pi, \mu, \Sigma)$, we simply need to find the derivatives w.r.t $\pi, \mu, \Sigma$, and then set them to 0, and compute these parameters such that $\Pr(\textbf{X}|\pi, \mu, \Sigma)$ has the optimal solution (max). So, look at,</p><p>$$
\Pr(\textbf{X} \mid \pi, \vec{\mu}, \Sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \sum_{j=1}^K \pi_j \mathcal{N}(\vec{x_i} \mid \vec{\mu_j}, \Sigma_j) \right]
= \prod_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \sum_{j=1}^K \pi_j \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^d |\Sigma_j|}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (\vec{x_i} - \vec{\mu_j})^T \Sigma_j^{-1} (\vec{x_i} - \vec{\mu_j}) \right) \right]
$$</p><p>This function is non-convex because it involves a sum of exponentials inside a product, leading to a log-likelihood that is the sum of log-sum-exp terms, which are non-convex in the parameters $\pi_j$, $\vec{\mu}_j$, and $\Sigma_j$. Thus, we <strong>transform it using logarithm and turning this problem into a log-likelihood maximization</strong>. Not writing everything down here, we get the following expressions for the parameters given generic cluster $k$:</p><p>$$\mu_k=\frac{1}{N_k}\sum_{i=1}^N\Pr(z_{i,k}=1|\vec{x}_i)\cdot\vec{x}_i$$</p><p>$$\Sigma_k=\frac{1}{N_k} = \sum_{i=1}^N\Pr(z_{i,k}=1|\vec{x}_i)(\vec{x}_i-\vec{\mu}_k)(\vec{x}_i-\vec{\mu}_k)^T$$</p><p>$$\pi_k=\frac{N_k}{N}$$
There is no closed-form solution, so we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively find a local maximum of the log-likelihood.</p><p>What is useful to see about the above two set of expressions is that: For a cluster $k$,</p><ul><li>Parameters $\vec{\mu_k}$, $\Sigma_k$, $\pi_k$ $\rightarrow$ $\Pr(z_{i,k}=1|\vec{x_i})$ (the bayes in first thing)</li><li>$\Pr(z_{i,k}=1|\vec{x}_i) \rightarrow \vec{\mu}_k, \Sigma_k, \pi_k$ parameters (the derivative in second thing)</li></ul><p>Since MLE can&rsquo;t be used because one of the variables ($z$) is hidden (we don&rsquo;t know the cluster assignment procedure yet before doing anything!), we can opt for Expectation Maximization or EM algorithm in which we can simply calculate the expected likelihood w.r.t the hidden variable $z$ without needing to know about it yet (initially).</p><p>The worded EM algorithm:</p><ol><li>Initialize $\theta=(\mu_k, \Sigma_k, \pi_k)$</li><li>E-Step: compute expected likelihoods w.r.t hidden variable $z$. Or calculate $\Pr_{\theta}(z_{i,k}=1|\vec{x}_i)$ from the 3 paremeters in $\theta$</li><li>M-Step: recompute the $\mu_k, \Sigma_k, \pi_k$ parameters to maximize the expected likelihoods. This means we get the new $$(\mu_k, \Sigma_k, \pi_k) = \arg\max_{\mu_k, \Sigma_k, \pi_k} \Pr_\theta(z_{i,k}=1 \mid \vec{x_i})$$ Repeat step 2 until convergence, meaning the change in log-likelihood or parameters falls below a threshold, or the log-likelihood no longer increases significantly.</li></ol><p>GMM is better than K-means because it does not assume the same-size clusters.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
