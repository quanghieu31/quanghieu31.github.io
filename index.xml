Time does fly. It seems that my butterfly worrying feelings days before the graduation day were crystal-clear present as if it were yesterday. Since that day, my mentality and emotions have fluctuated pretty much, you know, being an actual adult, no cap. Although I am grateful for everything so far, particularly the experiences and people I had from Dickinson College and my current employment and mental state, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel&amp;hellip; regretful.</description></item><item><title>Những chữ đầu tiên</title><link>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 23:44:17 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/first/</guid><description>Hi!

Anyhow, if you feel so, remember that everything is going to be daijoubu.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://quanghieu31.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quanghieu31.github.io/about/</guid><description>I develop this web to practice writing concisely and well explaining complex things to me. Current topics mostly regard programming and economics. In the long run, I would like to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic/quant modelling.
I used to work for an non-profit organization in Vietnam, focusing on database and program evaluation. I did know a little about econometrics and some topology from Dickinson College - amazing times but regrettably under-utilized.</description></item></channel></rss>
