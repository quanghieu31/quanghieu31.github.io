I enjoy sitting in lectures and occasionally interacting with the lecturers. But then I recently realized it is not the most proactive and sustainable way to remember or know why/when/how to use concepts learned from stats class when dealing with a real-world problem. The assignments and projects are helpful but I need to feel natural and comfortable explaining and applying the knowledge later.</description></item><item><title>First few words</title><link>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 23:44:17 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/first/</guid><description>This is for Hieu in the future. Very nice working on your first web! After many weekend hours, you did it. It was thrilling learning experience. I am proud of you, please don&amp;rsquo;t be skeptical of yourself, even though I bet that you are right now haha. Anyhow, if you feel so, remember that everything is going to be daijoubu.
Many thanks to my bro (https://cryptsu.github.io/) who has helped me so much during the design and development.</description></item><item><title>Hi!

Time passed, plan changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.
I am a Master&amp;rsquo;s student in Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. Here, I am studying how to build good databases and relevant practices, which will be used for policy analysis and prediction tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>
